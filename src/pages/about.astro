						I'm Filipi, a passionate Full-Stack Engineer dedicated to solving problems and creating impactful products. I thrive on helping
						my team become more effective and mentoring less experienced developers to grow and learn.
					</p>

					<p>
						Currently, I'm working at Purp, where I'm innovating social apps that transform how people connect and build relationships.
						Previously, at BuiltGrid, I had the privilege of developing groundbreaking solutions that revolutionize the construction market
						in Australia.
					</p>

					<p>
						With expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript, I build web and mobile applications using React and React Native. I strive to
						create beautiful, user-friendly interfaces that offer real solutions. Additionally, I excel in developing RESTful APIs using
						NodeJS, Prisma, and various NoSQL and SQL databases.
					</p>

					<p>
						I love challenging myself with side projects, some of which you can find on my website (filipirafael.com). I also share my
						knowledge and insights through articles on my Medium profile (https://medium.com/@filipirafael.123).
					</p>

					<p>
						Driven by continuous growth, I study English daily with native teachers to enhance my communication skills. Having gained
						international experience as a front-end developer, I'm eager to explore opportunities that allow me to make a global impact.
